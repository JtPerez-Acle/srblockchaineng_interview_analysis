# Project Analysis Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains an extensive analysis of a blockchain-based NFT staking system realized by Jose Tomas Perez-Acle, focusing on security, permissions, and architectural design. The analysis covers smart contract evaluation, permission structures, and implementation considerations.
